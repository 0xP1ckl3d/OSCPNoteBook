## Introduction

The Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) is a hands-on and challenging certification. This notebook is a reflection of my journey, the tools I found, and the techniques I learned. While it's tailored to my experience during the 2022 course, I hope it serves as a useful resource for others on the same path.
